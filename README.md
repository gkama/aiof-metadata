### How to run it

The application is setup as a Flask API. In order to start the application, you must `cd` into the correct directory `../api`. Once there, simply run the `flask run` command. Sometimes, you would have to setup the `FLASK_APP` environment variable. In order to do that in powershell, run `$env:FLASK_APP="api"`
